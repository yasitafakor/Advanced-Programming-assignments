# Java List Implementations

This project demonstrates the implementation of custom `LinkedList` and `ArrayList` in Java. The implementation focuses on fundamental list operations and includes specialized methods for handling array-based lists.

## Project Structure

- **Node Class**: Represents a node in the linked list with `data` and `child` attributes. Includes setter and getter methods.
- **List Interface**: Defines the basic list operations like `insert`, `delete`, `replace`, and `getData`.
- **LinkedList Class**: Implements the `List` interface, providing the standard operations for a linked list.
- **ArrayList Class**: Implements the `List` interface, with additional methods such as `shiftForward`, `expand`, `shrink`, and `shiftBackwards` to manage array list specific behaviors.
