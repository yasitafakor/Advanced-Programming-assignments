# Advanced Programming Assignments

This repository contains a collection of Java-based projects that showcase various concepts and techniques in advanced programming, with a strong emphasis on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Each project is organized into its own folder and demonstrates different aspects of Java programming, from data structures to graphical interfaces.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Calculator

The **Calculator** project is a fully functional calculator application that utilizes OOP principles and Java's graphical capabilities. It includes a user-friendly interface with multiple panels and supports a wide range of operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, and power functions.

### 2. LinkedList & ArrayList

This project focuses on implementing two fundamental data structures: **LinkedList** and **ArrayList**. Using OOP principles, both data structures are built from scratch, with support for basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and data retrieval. Additionally, `ArrayList` includes methods for shifting elements, expanding, and shrinking the list dynamically.

### 3. Store

The **Store** project simulates a product and sales management system. It includes several classes that handle different aspects of product and sale data, such as storing, retrieving, and managing information from files or terminal input. Key features include:
- **Product and Sale Classes**: Representing the entities with relevant attributes.
- **File and Input Data Sources**: For saving and loading data from files or terminal.
- **Repository**: Integrates various components and manages the overall workflow.
- **Main Class**: Provides an interactive interface for users to manage products and sales.

### 4. String Validator

The **String Validator** project is a utility designed to validate strings based on specific criteria. Using OOP principles, it includes multiple classes that check:
- Whether a string meets the required length to be used in a form.
- Whether a string is a valid email address.

This project is particularly useful for validating user input in forms and ensuring data integrity.
